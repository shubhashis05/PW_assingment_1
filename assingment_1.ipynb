    "->Exception in Python:\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot handle (like division by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or invalid input), it raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are runtime errors, meaning they occur while the program is running. Python provides mechanisms (try-except blocks) to handle exceptions gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "inPython, exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors, but they occur at different stages and for different reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions\n",
    "Occur during program execution (runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "Happen due to logical issues (e.g., dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or incorrect data type operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be handled using try-except blocks to prevent crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors\n",
    "Occur before execution (when Python checks the code structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Happen due to incorrect Python syntax (e.g., missing colons, unmatched parentheses, or wrong indentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot be handled—must be fixed before the program runs.\n",
    "\n",

    "->When an exception occurs in Python and is not handled, the program stops immediately and displays an error message (traceback). This is called an unhandled exception, and it causes the program to crash instead of continuing execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let’s say we try to divide a number by zero, which raises a ZeroDivisionError. If we don’t handle it, the program crashes:\n",
